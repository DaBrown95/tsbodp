# Actor state dispatch and connected handoffs

This batch reconstructs 13 Thumb C functions spanning 3,512 verified bytes. The
names describe static accesses and call relationships; selector-derived handler
names deliberately preserve uncertainty about gameplay roles. Each complete
extent, including pools and zero alignment, matches its fixed ROM address. Real
source mutations fail the same comparison. This is source reconstruction evidence;
no runtime or gameplay test is claimed here.

## Dispatch evidence

The published actor tick and resource-driven actor callback call `0x5804`. The
callee switches on the actor byte at `+0x4D`, bounds it by 47 and uses a 48-entry
word table at `0x5820`. The table resolves all transfers; states 31, 32 and 33
share one callee. The other direct calls identify 28 further callee entries.
State 1 clears flags bit 0 and sets `0x82`. States 0, 2–6, 10–12, 14–15, 18,
20–21 and 29–30 perform no action; values above 47 also return.

The no-op case 0 remains explicit in C: removing it makes the compiler build a
47-entry table with a subtract-one index. The retained failed candidate differs
in the dispatcher prefix/table. State 37 and state 38 call handlers without an
actor argument; inspection of both callees confirms they access global game
state and do not consume the incoming actor. Their broader side effects remain
unconverted.

The C case order follows the observed block layout. It does not contain original
instructions or table bytes. The only assembly directive emits zero tail
alignment, as in other accepted Thumb functions.

## Connected behavior and data views

State 23 requests animation 5, sets the `+0x4E` substate to 19, and waits for
flags `0x400000` before requesting animation 1 and restoring the actor's default
state. State 25 waits for the same completion bit, requests animation 90 and
cue 161, then moves the first view's actor to state 37 and plays cue 27. Before
completion, frame byte `+0xDB == 15` triggers cue 78. These call the already
reconstructed animation and game-audio paths.

State 40 stores the cue-46 sample handle at `+0x68`, requests animation 68, and
starts a signed 60-frame countdown at `+0x58`. When decrement reaches -1, it
stops that handle, requests animation 69 and selects state 47. The integer
sample handle agrees with the canonical game-audio stop-sample API.

States 7 and 26 read waypoint-group/index bytes at `+0x64/+0x65`. Resource data
is reached through the pointer at `0x03002EE0`: a halfword offset table begins
at data `+2`; each selected group has a byte count and records beginning at
`+4`, with stride eight. Records begin with two signed halfword coordinates.
The coordinate reader returns a two-word point by value. Its hidden aggregate
return pointer explains both caller argument placement and the callee preserving
R0 through its return sequence. A void output-pointer trial differed at that
return sequence and is retained.

The waypoint handlers shift the returned coordinates left by 16 and pass the
point to the unconverted route initializer at `0x370D0`. A result word at actor
`+0x54` records route status; the unsigned branch in state 34 establishes its
unsigned view. The timer at `+0x58` is signed and expires at -1. A byte at `+0x66`
sets wait duration in units of 30 frames. The names in `FrameActorStateWork`
apply to these selectors; other actor overlays reuse these addresses.

State 7 chooses a waypoint different from the previous index, starts a route
with argument 3 and cycles through walking/waiting substates. State 26 starts
with route argument 0, waits and then asks the unconverted `0x6F20` selector for
a need-related target/action; the selected action is attempted by `0x2E0B8`.
State 34 obtains a scene target from `0x3A614`, starts a route and branches on
route results 1/2/3 before advancing into state 43. These names are provisional;
there is no claim that the route and target subsystems are fully reconstructed.

State 24 alternates walking and waiting, choosing directions through `0x8994`
and an eight-direction table at `0x52880`. Its signed timer uses 90- and
300-frame periods. The halfword at `+0xAC` also redirects walking into waiting;
`contact` is a provisional name for this field. At wait expiry it attempts the
same need target/action handoff as state 26, or resumes wandering.

State 35 has a 62-entry table at `0x6250`, indexed by substate minus two. Its
eight active selectors are 2, 7, 25, 41, 45, 61, 62 and 63. Other entries share
the return block. It initializes a random waiting period, tries a destination
route when flags `0x800000` permit, and makes probabilistic interaction attempts
based on subtype, world ID and a game-state byte at `+0x0A`. Coordinate bounds
select two world-specific stationary animations. If no action succeeds, it
chooses between a need target and renewed wandering. Movement result, animation
completion, contact halfword and timer then drive its remaining substates.
The game-state byte is called `clock` only provisionally; its real temporal or
quest meaning is not established. The canonical game-state global is reused
through a bounded overlay, and the published main actor layout is unchanged.

The movement-direction chooser reads actor `+0xC4` as a cell argument and uses
the shared registration/context pointer at `0x03004330`. It first tests two
successive neighboring cells, requiring classification bit 2 and no bits from
mask `0x3D`; its second pass tests one neighbor. It advances direction by two
and wraps values above eight, remembering the initial direction to bound each
loop. A further actor-specific availability check at `0x8BEC` determines success.
The chooser keeps both fallback directions and returns a byte success value.
These call shapes and tests support its name more closely than the earlier
need-selector context alias `frame_actor_need_bit2_effect`; helper and bit
meanings remain provisional. It is natural C without fixed register variables.

The direction setter narrows its input to one byte, compares/stores `+0x12`
and sets pending-update bit `0x10` only when direction changes. It connects
these route handlers to the accepted animation/direction refresh path.

The two waypoint resource readers use fixed C register variables for the byte
offset and offset-table address. These constrain compiler allocation; the
expressions remain typed pointer/record operations, and no instruction body is
embedded. Their first natural C candidates and subsequent raw mismatches remain
local. The full extent and changed-source controls verify these constraints.

## Local proofs and remaining boundaries

Private ready metadata is `reports/agents/vblank-wrapper/actor-state-batch-manifest.json`.
Full positive/control comparisons against the current headers are retained under
`reports/agents/vblank-wrapper/actor-state-current13-*`. Original CFG scans and
all 29 handler entry summaries remain in the same ignored agent report tree.
Mutations change the dispatcher flags, animation IDs, countdown, wait factor,
direction update flag, group offset, record stride and state transition target.

Eight of the 29 direct handler functions are reconstructed here. Useful next
connected targets are the need target selector `0x6F20`, action-target selector
`0x7DC4`, actor direction-availability helper `0x8BEC`, and the route initializer/
cancel family at `0x370D0/0x37464`. State 16 (`0x5CA4`) joins input, interaction choices,
needs and world-condition checks but has a larger substate table. Their scanned
CFGs are closed; those scans alone do not establish C coverage, final function
boundaries or runtime reachability. Other handlers and route bodies remain
explicit unconverted ROM regions in the full build.
